<h1>Week 5:"Catch These Hands"</h1>
<br><br>
<h3>Assignment: Model and 3D print something</h3>

<h2><u>Step 1: Setup</u><h2></h4> Based of the name of this week, I wanted to attempt to 3-D scan 
  my hands, little did I know me "catching my own hands" just meant i was 
punching myself in the face. Evidently I was unaware of how such a simple idea
could lead to a learning event i shall soon not forget.  </h4>
<br><br>
<h4> Gleefully stumbling into this project I proceeded to play arts-and-crafts 
  on "These Hands" using markers and pens. Under the advice of Bobby, this would ensure my 
  hand was in the same position and give the 3-D scanner a better chance of picking 
  up the intricacies of my hand.

<h2><u>Step2: Utter Disappointment</u><h2></h4> Soon I learned that what Bobby meant 
by "intricasies" was I was in for a world of hurt. After my first two failures, I learned
I needed to become a contortionist to move the 3-D scanner around my now stationary hand and forearm.
 30 minutes in and my body was shaking so much each attempt looked like the one below. </h4>

 <br><br>
<h4>I took a short reprieve from the onslaughnt of my own poor decisions to rethink
  my life goals while allowing my body to recover before the next round of punishment. 
This seemed to be sucessful as the next scans began to come out more sucessfully. </h4>

<br><br>
<h2><u>Step 3: Merging</u><h2><h4> As you can see the hand is beginning to take 
shape, but large holes were still present because I couldnt get the 
full 360deg scan in one take. To solve this I took a few more 
scans and managed to merge them. With some post-process editing I was able to 
get something that resembled my left hand. </h4>

<br><br>
<h4>The hand is not perfect, but it was the best I could do after picking up
  3-D scanning in one day.
</h4>
<br><br>
<h2><u>Step 4: Optimization</u></h2><h4>A lot of my struggle stemmed from having
  to use the 3-D scanner with a broken mount. I wanted to ease the suffering for future 
  students by attempting to make a 3-D print that adapted the screw handle I was using, to the mounting 
  system it was designed for.
</h4>
<br><br>
<h4>For this job I wanted to use 3-D printing for its ability to allow for rapid prototyping.
  The channel of the mounting system was intricate and I wanted to rapidly test 
  fits and redesign as necessary. Also by using 3-D printing instead of reductive 
  methods, there is much less material wasted on fitments that didnt work. From CAD
  to prototype took 4-10 minutes based on the stage of the design process. Also each print
  used minimal materials, with the last and largest being only 1.58g of PLA filament. Each print helped to 
  discover a new design implementation and try it out rapidly.

<h4>The final design included a tapered rail, key channel for locking mechanism,
  and a hex head hole with tight tolerances for a press-fit into the attaching screw.
